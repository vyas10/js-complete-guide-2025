## Note 1: String Identifiers

- String Identifiers can have typos so they are not always reliable.
- It is better to store string in a variable and use that variable to refer to the string.

## Note 2:

- if statements don't return a value

## Note 3: Expressions vs Statements

- Expressions are evaluated to produce a value.
- Statements are executed to perform an action.
- Example of an expression: `5 + 3` evaluates to `8`.
- Example of a statement: `print("Hello")` performs the action of printing.

## Note 4: !!, || and &&

- `!!` is used to convert a value to a boolean.
- `||` is the logical OR operator.
- `&&` is the logical AND operator.
