## Note 1: String Identifiers

- String Identifiers can have typos so they are not always reliable.
- It is better to store string in a variable and use that variable to refer to the string.

## Note 2:

- if statements don't return a value

## Note 3: Expressions vs Statements

- Expressions are evaluated to produce a value.
- Statements are executed to perform an action.
- Example of an expression: `5 + 3` evaluates to `8`.
- Example of a statement: `print("Hello")` performs the action of printing.

## Note 4: !!, || and &&

- `!!` is used to convert a value to a boolean.
- `||` is the logical OR operator.
- `&&` is the logical AND operator.

## Note 5: For, ForOf, ForIn

- `for` loops iterate over a range or collection.
- `for...of` loops iterate over iterable objects like arrays.
- `for...in` loops iterate over the keys of an object.

## Note 6: What is Ecmascript & ES6?

- ECMAScript is the standard (or official rulebook) that defines how the JavaScript language should work.
- Think of ECMAScript as the specification (rulebook) that says what JavaScript can do and how it should behave.
- Itâ€™s managed by a group called TC39 (Technical Committee 39).
- ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth edition of the Ecmascript standard.
- It introduced many new features and improvements to JavaScript.
- ES6 introduced new features like arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring.
